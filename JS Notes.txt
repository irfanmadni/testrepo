var let difference 
1. var is old JS(ES5) while let is new JS(ES6)
2. var is function scoped  while let is blocked scoped

function abc(){

	for(var i = 0; i<10; i++)
	{
	}
	c.l(i);
}


function abc(){

	for(let i = 0; i<10; i++)
	{
	}
	c.l(i); // ERROR
}


3. There are few things which are not part of JS but they are given by browser. i.e window, document, settimeout.
goto .....console write ... window..... and see the object. 
you can find them all in window object. 
window is an object given by brower not by the language. 

3.1 var adds itself in window object. while let does not.
var a = 10;
let b = 20;

now goto window by console and check your will find a in the list but not b. 

// ---------------Lec 3--------------

4. There are three types which are reference types.
	1. [] Arry
	2. {} Object
	3. () Function

	var a = 12; premative value
	var b = [1,2,3,4,5]; reference value 
	var c = b;

	b.pop();

	console.clo
